# Get started

This 5-minute tutorial will show you how to run your first jobs with MRQ.

## Installation

 - Make sure you have installed the [dependencies](dependencies.md) : Redis and MongoDB
 - Install MRQ with `pip install mrq`
 - Start a mongo server with `mongod &`
 - Start a redis server with `redis-server &`


## Write your first task

Create a new directory and write a simple task in a file called `tasks.py` :

```makefile
$ mkdir test-mrq && cd test-mrq
$ touch __init__.py
$ vim tasks.py
```

```python
from mrq.task import Task
import urllib2


class Fetch(Task):

    def run(self, params):

        with urllib2.urlopen(params["url"]) as f:
          t = f.read()
          return len(t)
```

## Run it synchronously

You can now run it from the command line using `mrq-run`:

```makefile
$ mrq-run tasks.Fetch url http://www.google.com

2014-12-18 15:44:37.869029 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: Connecting to MongoDB at 127.0.0.1:27017/mrq...
2014-12-18 15:44:37.880115 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: ... connected.
2014-12-18 15:44:37.880305 [DEBUG] Starting tasks.Fetch({'url': 'http://www.google.com'})
2014-12-18 15:44:38.158572 [DEBUG] Job None success: 0.278229s total
17655
```

## Run it asynchronously

Let's schedule the same task 3 times with different parameters:

```makefile
$ mrq-run --queue fetches tasks.Fetch url http://www.google.com &&
  mrq-run --queue fetches tasks.Fetch url http://www.yahoo.com &&
  mrq-run --queue fetches tasks.Fetch url http://www.wordpress.com

2014-12-18 15:49:05.688627 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: Connecting to MongoDB at 127.0.0.1:27017/mrq...
2014-12-18 15:49:05.705400 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: ... connected.

2014-12-18 15:49:06.182351 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: Connecting to MongoDB at 127.0.0.1:27017/mrq...
2014-12-18 15:49:06.193314 [DEBUG] mongodb_jobs: ... connected.

5492f772520d1887c5b32881
```

You can see that instead of executing the tasks and returning their results right away, `mrq-run` has added them to the queue named `fetches` and printed their IDs.

Now start MRQ's dasbhoard with `mrq-dashboard &` and go check your newly created queue and jobs on [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555/#jobs)

They are ready to be dequeued by a worker. Start one with `mrq-worker` and follow it on the dashboard as it executes the queued jobs in parallel.

```makefile
$ mrq-worker fetches

2014-12-18 15:52:57.362209 [INFO] Starting Gevent pool with 10 worker greenlets (+ report, logs, adminhttp)

```

You can interrupt the worker with Ctrl-C once it is finished.

## Going further

This was a preview on the very basic features of MRQ. What makes it actually useful is that:

* You can run multiple workers in parallel. Each worker can also run multiple greenlets in parallel.
* Workers can dequeue from multiple queues
* You can queue jobs from your Python code to avoid using `mrq-run` from the command-line.
